Call an array a of length n sorted if a1≤a2≤…≤an−1≤an.

Ntarsis has an array a of length n.

He is allowed to perform one type of operation on it (zero or more times):

Choose an index i (1≤i≤n−1).
Add 1 to a1,a2,…,ai.Subtract 1 from ai+1,ai+2,…,an
.
The values of a can be negative after an operation.

Determine the minimum operations needed to make a not sorted.

Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1≤t≤100). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2≤n≤500) — the length of the array a.

The next line contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤10^9) — the values of array a.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 500.

Output
Output the minimum number of operations needed to make the array not sorted.

Note
In the first case, we can perform 1 operation to make the array not sorted:

Pick i=1. The array a then becomes [2,0], which is not sorted.In the second case, we can perform 2 operations to make the array not sorted:

Pick i=3. The array a then becomes [2,9,11,12].
Pick i=3. The array a then becomes [3,10,12,11], which is not sorted.
It can be proven that 1 and 2 operations are the minimal numbers of operations in the first and second test cases, respectively.

In the third case, the array is already not sorted, so we perform 0 operations.
