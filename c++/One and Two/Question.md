You are given a sequence a1,a2,…,an. Each element of a is 1 or 2.

Find out if an integer k exists so that the following conditions are met.

1≤k≤n−1, anda1⋅a2⋅…⋅ak=ak+1⋅ak+2⋅…⋅an.
If there exist multiple k that satisfy the given condition, print the smallest.

Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1≤t≤100). Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2≤n≤1000).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤2).

Output
For each test case, if there is no such k, print −1.

Otherwise, print the smallest possible k.

Example
Input
3
6
2 2 1 2 1 2
3
1 2 1
4
1 1 1 1
Output
2
-1
1

Note
For the first test case, k=2 satisfies the condition since a1⋅a2=a3⋅a4⋅a5⋅a6=4. k=3 also satisfies the given condition, but the smallest should be printed.

For the second test case, there is no k that satisfies a1⋅a2⋅…⋅ak=ak+1⋅ak+2⋅…⋅an

For the third test case, k=1, 2, and 3 satisfy the given condition, so the answer is 1.
