Given an array a of length n, which elements are equal to −1 and 1. Let's call the array a good if the following conditions are held at the same time:

a1+a2+…+an≥0;

a1⋅a2⋅…⋅an=1.
In one operation, you can select an arbitrary element of the array ai and change its value to the opposite. In other words, if ai=−1, you can assign the value to ai:=1, and if ai=1, then assign the value to ai:=−1.

Determine the minimum number of operations you need to perform to make the array a good. It can be shown that this is always possible.

Input
Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤500) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤n≤100) — the length of the array a.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (ai=±1) — the elements of the array a.

Output
For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations that need to be done to make the a array good.

Note
In the first test case, we can assign the value a1:=1. Then a1+a2+a3+a4=1+(−1)+1+(−1)=0≥0 and a1⋅a2⋅a3⋅a4=1⋅(−1)⋅1⋅(−1)=1. Thus, we performed 1 operation.

In the second test case, we can assign a1:=1. Then a1+a2+a3+a4+a5=1+(−1)+(−1)+1+1=1≥0 and a1⋅a2⋅a3⋅a4⋅a5=1⋅(−1)⋅(−1)⋅1⋅1=1. Thus, we performed 1 operation.

In the third test case, a1+a2+a3+a4=(−1)+1+(−1)+1=0≥0 and a1⋅a2⋅a3⋅a4=(−1)⋅1⋅(−1)⋅1=1. Thus, all conditions are already satisfied and no operations are needed.

In the fourth test case, we can assign the values a1:=1,a2:=1,a3:=1. Then a1+a2+a3=1+1+1=3≥0 and a1⋅a2⋅a3=1⋅1⋅1=1. Thus, we performed 3 operations.
